01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:41.680
<v Jane Smythe>What would you might be at the moment it's in the investment, the investment.</v>

01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:51.700
<v Jane Smythe>So what is the investment is spread out between shares and bonds, 90,000, but 30,400 will be in an ISA, OK.</v>

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:52.690
<v Jane Smythe>It keeps it tax efficient.</v>

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:58.280
<v Jane Smythe>So the more growth you make the more tax efficient it's the rest will be outside an ISA, OK.</v>

01:40:58.430 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Jane Smythe>But what I would say is from next April, I can automatically wrap it in ISA, yes, so fund managers will automatically and then that's a good idea.</v>

01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:10.510
<v Jane Smythe>By the time a few years gone, everything will be isa wrapped.</v>

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.630
<v Charlie Green>That'll be perfect.</v>

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.180
<v Charlie Green>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.220
<v Charlie Green>HM.</v>

01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:22.550
<v Charlie Green>OK.</v>

01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Jane Smythe>You have got eyes to liability.</v>

01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:26.810
<v Jane Smythe>So what are your thoughts now we're talking about all this.</v>

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:43.220
<v Charlie Green>Do you wanna take advice on take advice I think on that because that was quite a lot, wasn't it? We said at the end, so do you wanna do that first before that would see, I think that would make perfect sense, but I I like the idea of the way you've sort of planned things at the moment.</v>

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:51.640
<v Charlie Green>HM So I think once I've taken them on board as well, HM I I'll be able to definitely say we want to do so.</v>

01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:53.260
<v Charlie Green>I can't see you until.</v>

01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:56.010
<v Jane Smythe>Let's just have a look</v>

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.970
<v Charlie Green>and see if that gives you plenty</v>

01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Jane Smythe>of time to get some.</v>

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:03.250
<v Charlie Green>Should I be doing any of that ISA wrapping at the moment?</v>

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.300
<v Jane Smythe>Because if you do it then I won't be able to access it.</v>

01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:08.310
<v Jane Smythe>Access it? So HM.</v>

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:09.650
<v Jane Smythe>Right.</v>

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.790
<v Jane Smythe>I can't see you in the first week.</v>

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:12.270
<v Jane Smythe>OK.</v>

01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:17.380
<v Jane Smythe>Second week, which is week commencing the 9th of January.</v>

01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Jane Smythe>Do you think I'll give you enough time to go and see?</v>

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:23.180
<v Charlie Green>I hope so.</v>

01:42:23.190 --> 01:42:25.300
<v Charlie Green>It's just as you say, we've Christmas coming now as</v>

01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.700
<v Jane Smythe>well.</v>

01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:25.970
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:30.710
<v Jane Smythe>I mean provisionally book it then what I'll do is I'll, we'll speak to each other if there's any difference you can.</v>

01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:31.400
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah.</v>

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:39.080
<v Jane Smythe>So if we say, let's just quickly bring up calendar up for January, OK.</v>

01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Charlie Green>So what sort of dates?</v>

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.280
<v Jane Smythe>Thinking potentially doing Wednesday the 11th, would that be OK? Yeah, lovely.</v>

01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Jane Smythe>And I'm thinking roughly this time again.</v>

01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:48.430
<v Charlie Green>Yep, 2:00 PM.</v>

01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:52.110
<v Jane Smythe>Fantastic.</v>

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:57.030
<v Jane Smythe>But are they took that advice and then we can move forward giving you advice.</v>

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.280
<v Jane Smythe>It's not sorted, you see.</v>

01:42:58.290 --> 01:42:59.130
<v Jane Smythe>That's lovely.</v>

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:03.770
<v Jane Smythe>So take that advice 1st and then you let me know how we're moving</v>

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Charlie Green>forward, definitely.</v>

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.580
<v Jane Smythe>Like you said, you want you want to do something with</v>

01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:14.790
<v Charlie Green>this money anyway, don't need to because HM.</v>

01:43:16.150 --> 01:43:24.270
<v Charlie Green>I I don't know what else they'll recommend to to be able to pass it over, but I know there's, excuse me, the seven-year rule, but yeah.</v>

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.430
<v Charlie Green>Apart from that, I'm not quite sure what else I can do with it.</v>

01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:30.260
<v Jane Smythe>HM yeah.</v>

01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:32.120
<v Jane Smythe>So they'll get guide you through it.</v>

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:39.200
<v Jane Smythe>There's there's various ways you can do things and you will give you that guidance on what you want to do and how you because I'm hoping this money's gonna grow for you.</v>

01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:40.340
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously again</v>

01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:41.400
<v Charlie Green>it's gonna</v>

01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Jane Smythe>increase in your status and it's.</v>

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Jane Smythe>So let's take your card out.</v>

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.780
<v Jane Smythe>Bear with me a second.</v>

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.280
<v Jane Smythe>Bear with me.</v>

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Jane Smythe>Thank you.</v>

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.470
<v Charlie Green>You're welcome.</v>

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.630
<v Charlie Green>Oh well, thank you for today.</v>

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:21.670
<v Charlie Green>It was it was the full 2 hours, wasn't it? I did say I hadn't realised it would really get to quite utter your card.</v>

01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:26.410
<v Charlie Green>To to that level but thank you very much.</v>

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Jane Smythe>You don't realise it and think about it, isn't it?</v>

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:36.520
<v Jane Smythe>When youm to be honest I think you need to as well because I think the options are there and gives you it makes you think as well.</v>

01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:37.060
<v Charlie Green>Yeah.</v>

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:46.600
<v Charlie Green>I think the problem is you see at home I've only been moved there two weeks and I still don't have an Internet and it's so frustrating because it's things like this when you're trying to look things up.</v>

01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:48.300
<v Charlie Green>I just haven't got anywhere to do that.</v>

01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:53.440
<v Jane Smythe>And exactly when I asked you do you have an iPad or because it saves you coming in I could do it through but you haven't.</v>

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.070
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, come through says actually</v>

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.470
<v Charlie Green>that hopefully on Monday they tell me on Monday I should have it.</v>

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:00.550
<v Charlie Green>So from then like should get easier.</v>

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.070
<v Charlie Green>But thank you so much for the face to face.</v>

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.450
<v Jane Smythe>I'm gonna see you again hopefully.</v>

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.390
<v Charlie Green>Let's hope you get</v>

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Jane Smythe>some guidance on your inheritance tax</v>

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.140
<v Charlie Green>and that's all I need.</v>

01:45:10.150 --> 01:45:10.470
<v Charlie Green>Then</v>

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.970
<v Jane Smythe>then then that way we can plan it.</v>

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Jane Smythe>So obviously like I said if it's not then we can postpone it.</v>

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Jane Smythe>It's not a problem because they're either you took</v>

01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:23.770
<v Charlie Green>that advice I don't wanna mess you around or your time completely on it but I think it looks as if it we're going.</v>

01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:25.680
<v Jane Smythe>Yeah, definitely.</v>

01:45:25.690 --> 01:45:26.820
<v Jane Smythe>I'm glad you've definitely</v>

01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:28.400
<v Charlie Green>got an idea that risk.</v>

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Jane Smythe>But I'd like to believe it.</v>
